  <idx><h>rotational motion</h></idx>
    <introduction>
      <p> As previously indicated, <term>kinematics</term> refers to the <em>description of motion</em>. If we toss a pencil across the room, its motion may appear quite complicated, wobbling around as it moves through the air. Its behavior can be more readily analyzed by separating its motion across the room from its wobbly motion. We'll therefore explore two basic types of motion in this chapter: <term>translational motion</term> (e.g., the pencil's movement from one side of the room to the other) will be the focus of <xref ref="lin-kin"/>, while <term>rotational motion</term> (e.g., the pencil's wobbling as it moves) will be the focus of <xref ref="rot-kin"/>. We'll return to the case of combination motion in <xref ref="combo-kin"/>.  
      </p>

      <p> NOTE: In physics, the word <q>translation</q> refers to an object's movement through space; in 1D, <q>translational motion</q> is also called <q>linear motion</q>. We'll consider the words <em>translational</em> and <em>linear</em> to be equivalent for most of this learning guide. Similarly, another term for <em>rotational motion</em> is <em>angular motion</em>, and those terms will also be considered interchangeable.

        As discussed at the beginning of this chapter, <em>translational motion</em> can refer to a portion of combined motion, or it can fully describe the motion. This section opens with an example of a case where translation is the only motion of interest, to motivate the definitions for kinematics quantities in the most straight-forward way possible.

    <subsection xml:id="lin-kin-defns">
      <title>Kinematics Definitions (Translational)</title> 
       <introduction>
        <p> Kinematics is the description of motion, so we'll be considering <em> where</em> an object is at specific <em>times</em>. The first three kinematics definitions <mdash/> <em> position, distance,</em> and <em>displacement</em><mdash/> will be motivated by a considering the specific example of going to a store. After pausing to practice with the initial definitions, the same example will be extended to motivate the definitions of <em>speed, velocity,</em> and <em>acceleration</em>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          SPECIAL NOTE: The equations in this subsection are <em>definitions</em>, which means that they are <em>always true</em>, in contrast to the specialized equations in <xref ref="constant-a-lin-eqns"/>, which aren't always true. 
          </p>
        <p>
        A note on units: we aren't restricting our consideration to SI units in this subsection in order to motivate a closer connection to everyday life, but we could easily convert to SI units if we knew the appropriate conversion factors (see <xref ref="units"/> for review). For example, we could convert to SI units in <xref ref="grocery-store-trip"/> if given the number of meters in a city block, and we could convert to SI units in <xref ref="more-grocery-store"/> by recalling that one minute equals 60 seconds.   
        </p>

         <p> (SI UNITS: meters, abbreviated as <m>m</m>) </p>
          <p>
            Imagine that you live on the same street as a grocery store, which is 6 blocks east of your home. You leave your home one day to go to this store, but after traveling 2 blocks you realize that you've left your wallet at home, so you turn around to retrieve it. You then travel the 6 blocks to the store. If asked how far you traveled, how would you answer? The two possible answers illustrate our first three  kinematics definitions:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p> 
              <term>Position</term> refers to location in space. (As discussed in <xref ref="precision"/>, position is always measured with respect to an arbitrary reference point.)  
            </p>
          </li>
    
          <li> 
            <p>
              <term>Distance</term> is the actual path traveled. It's a <em>scalar</em> quantity (see <xref ref="vectors"/>). Distance has no direction, so distances always add. 
              </p>
              <p> Using <m>d</m> to represent <em>distance</em>, we can write this definition in equation form:   
                 <men> d = d_{1} + d_{2} + d_{3} + \cdots </men>
            </p> 
         </li>
          
          <li> 
            <p>
              <term>Displacement</term> is the change in position. It is a <em>vector</em> quantity, having both magnitude and direction. (NOTE: Even though position itself is arbitrary, <em>change in position</em> isn't; both the <em>initial</em> and <em> final</em> positions must be measured with respect to the same (arbitrary) reference point, and the subtraction process eliminates any ambiguity.)  
              </p>

            <p> Using <m>\vec{x}</m> to represent position (and <m>\Delta</m> to represent <q>change</q>), this definition can be written in equation form as:
                   <men> \Delta\vec{x} = \vec{x}_{\text{final}} - \vec{x}_{\text{initial}} </men>

       <title>Speed and Velocity</title>
       <idx><h>speed</h></idx>
       <idx><h>velocity</h></idx>

       <p> (SI UNITS: meters/second, abbreviated as <m>m/s</m>)</p>
          <p>
            To motivate the remaining kinematics defintions, we need to also consider <em>time</em>. Let's imagine it took you 3 minutes to walk the first 2 blocks towards the store, 4 minutes to walk back to your house to retrieve your wallet, and then 8 minutes to walk the 6 blocks to the store. If asked how fast you traveled, how would you answer? The multiple ways to answer that question illustrate important aspects of our next two kinematics definitions, <em>speed</em> and <em>velocity</em>.
          </p>
        <p>
          First of all, we notice that the time interval under consideration matters alot! Are we concerned with the trip as a whole, or with the various portions of the trip? We'll explore this point more carefully after defining the terms and practicing with the equations, but for now just know that the concept of <q>average</q> (denoted by the subscript <q>ave</q> in the subsequent equations) is included to acknowledge that both speed and velocity depend on the time interval. 
          </p> 
        
        <ul>
         <li> 
            <p>
              <term>Speed</term> is the rate at which distance is covered. 
              </p>
                <p> Using <m>d</m> to again represent distance, <m>t</m> to represent the time it takes to travel that distance, and <m>s_{\text{ave}}</m> to represent the average speed over that interval, we can write this definition in equation form:   
                 <men> s_{\text{ave}} = \frac{d}{t} </men>
            Notice that since distance and time are both scalars, speed is also a <em>scalar</em> quantity. 
            </p> 
          </li>
          
          <li> 
            <p>
              <term>Velocity</term> is the rate at which displacement occurs. 
            </p>
            <p> Using <m>\Delta\vec{x}</m> to again represent displacement, <m>\Delta t</m> to represent the time interval over which the displacement occurred, and <m>\vec{v}_{\text{ave}}</m> to represent the average velocity over that time interval, this definition can be written in equation form as:
                   <men> \vec{v}_{\text{ave}} = \frac{\Delta\vec{x}}{\Delta t} = \frac{\vec{x}_{\text{final}} - \vec{x}_{\text{initial}}}{t_{\text{final}} - t_{\text{initial}}}  </men>
             Here, the positions and times are correlated: the initial position is the location of the object at the initial time (which could be zero, if you start your clock when the motion begins), and the final position is the location of the object at the final time (which could only be a step along the entire journey). As we'll see in <xref ref="ex-speed-velocity"/>, often only the displacements and time intervals matter. </p>
             <p>It's also important to note that since displacement is a vector (and time is a scalar), velocity is also a <em>vector</em> quantity, having both magnitude and direction (see <xref ref="vectors"/>). The direction of the velocity is the same as the direction of the displacement (its magnitude is just <q>scaled</q> by the numerical value of the time interval, as are its units).

      <exercise xml:id="ex-speed-velocity">
        <introduction>
          <p> Let's return to the example of the grocery store trip to explore the kinematics definitions of speed and velocity.    
            </p>
        </introduction>

        <task>
          <statement>
              <p>
                What was your average speed for the entire trip?

            </statement>
            <answer>
              <p>
                To calculate your average speed for the entire trip, we must use the total distance you traveled (found in <xref ref="ex-distance-displacement"/> to be 10 blocks) and the total time it took you to travel that distance (15 minutes, found by adding the times for each portion of the trip). Your average speed for the entire trip was therefore:
                <me> s_{\text{ave}} = \frac{10\text{blks}}{15\text{mins}} = 0.7\text{bks/min} </me>

            <answer>
              <p>
                To calculate your average velocity for the entire trip, we must use your total displacement (found in <xref ref="ex-distance-displacement"/> to be 6 blocks to the east) and the total time it took for that displacement to occur (15 minutes). Your average velocity for the entire trip was therefore:
                <me> \vec{v}_{\text{ave}}= \frac{6\text{blks to the east}}{15\text{mins}} = 0.4\text{bks/min, to the east} </me>

          <answer>
            <p> You should be able to work these out on your own by now. </p>
            <p> The answers are:
            Part 1 of trip (2 blocks towards store in 3 minutes):
            <me> s_{\text{ave}_1} = \frac{2\text{blks}}{3\text{mins}} = 0.7\text{bks/min} </me>
            <me>\vec{v}_{\text{ave}_1}= \frac{2\text{blks to the east}}{3\text{mins}} = 0.7\text{bks/min, to the east} </me>
            
            Part 2 of trip (2 blocks back home in 4 minutes):
            <me> s_{\text{ave}_2} = \frac{2\text{blks}}{4\text{mins}} = 0.5\text{bks/min} </me>
            <me>\vec{v}_{\text{ave}_2}= \frac{-2\text{blks to the east}}{4\text{mins}} = - 0.5\text{bks/min to the east} </me>
            (NOTE: In physical terms, this is <m> 0.5\text{blks/min to the west}</m>) </p>
            <p>
            Part 3 of trip (6 blocks to store in 8 minutes):
            <me> s_{\text{ave}_3} = \frac{6\text{blks}}{8\text{mins}} = 0.8\text{bks/min} </me>
            <me>\vec{v}_{\text{ave}_3}= \frac{6\text{blks to the east}}{8\text{mins}} = 0.8\text{bks/min, to the east} </me>

         </answer>
       </task>
     </exercise>

     <p>
      Before continuing, we should take note of a few things from <xref ref="ex-speed-velocity"/>: (a) both your speed and your velocity changed during your trip to the grocery store (e.g., you were traveling slowest during Part 2 of the trip), and (b) the magnitude of the average velocity for each portion of the trip was the same as the average speed, but that wasn't true when the time interval was expanded to include the entire trip. These observations motivate the general statements below:  
     </p>

     <ul>
         <li> 
            <p>
              <term>Time-averaged values</term><mdash/> or, more simply, <em> average values</em><mdash/> always depend on the time interval under consideration. 
              </p>
              <p> GENERAL STATEMENT: The magnitide of the average velocity is equal to the average speed only for the special case of one-dimensional motion in a single direction (because that's the only case where the magnitude of the displacement is equal to the distance).  
              </p>
              <p> GENERAL STATEMENT: As the time interval under consideration gets smaller, more detailed information emerges. 
            </p> 
          </li>
          
          <li> 
            <p>
              <term>Instantaneous values</term> are when the time interval shrinks down to an instant. (Although mathematically, this requires the concept of a <em>limit</em>, which is beyond the scope of this learning guide, we will soon see that in practice there are often other ways to determine instantaneous values.)    
            </p>
             <p>GENERAL STATEMENT: The magnitude of the instantaneous velocity is <em>always</em> equal to the instantaneous speed.
             </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        
    <subsubsection xml:id="last-grocery-store">
        <title>Acceleration</title>
        <idx><h>acceleration</h></idx>

         <p> SI UNITS: (meters/second)/second, abbreviated as <m>m/s^2</m>. </p>
          <p>
          The example of the grocery store trip also motivates our final kinematics definition, as we can see that the velocity (and speed) changed from one part of the trip to another.        
          </p>
      <p> <term>Acceleration</term> is the rate at which velocity changes.     
          </p>         
          <p> Using <m>\vec{a}_{\text{ave}}</m> to represent the average acceleration over the time interval <m>\Delta t</m>, this definition can be written in equation form as:
                  <men> \vec{a}_{\text{ave}} = \frac{\Delta\vec{v}}{\Delta t} = \frac{\vec{v}_{\text{final}} - \vec{v}_{\text{initial}}}{t_{\text{final}} - t_{\text{initial}}}  </men>
             Here, too, the (instantaneous) velocities and times are correlated: the initial velocity is the velocity of the object at the initial time (which could be zero, if you start your clock when the motion begins), and the final velocity is the location of the object at the final time (which could only be a step along the entire journey). 
             </p>

      <exercise xml:id="ex-acceleration">
        <introduction>
          <p> Let's pause here for a moment to explore the kinematics definition of acceleration.

        </introduction>

        <task>
          <statement>
              <p>
                Where were the places of acceleration in the grocery store trip?

            </statement>
            <answer>
              <p>
                Acceleration <em>definitely</em> occured during two time intervals of the trip: the transition period from Part 1 to Part 2 and the transition period from Part 2 to Part 3; both the magnitude and the direction of the velocity changed during each of these transition periods. Without knowing the amount of time for each change to occur, however, the numerical value of the acceleration cannot be determined.
              </p>
              <p>
                NOTE: There may have also been periods of acceleration within each part of the trip. (For example, compare the two "Grocery Store Trip" graphs in <xref ref="graphing-motion"/>.) The consistency of motion is sometimes stated explicitly, while other times it's implicit in the problem's statement. It's crucial to consider the consistency of motion before attempting to use the special-case equations in <xref ref="constant-a-lin-eqns"/>.

We can calculate changes in magnitude directly from the equation for acceleration, and we can employ graphical methods to that equation to determine the acceleration resulting from changes in direction. (See <xref ref="vectors"/> as a reminder of the background upon which <xref ref="figure-car-on-curve"/> and <xref ref="figure-acceleration-cases"/> both rely.)

             Returning now to the definition of acceleration, we also note that since velocity is a vector, acceleration is a vector quantity having the same direction as the <em>change in velocity</em> vector (just scaled by the time interval). Acceleration happens when the magnitude and/or direction of the velocity changes. See <xref ref="figure-car-on-curve"/>  for a specific example and <xref ref="figure-acceleration-cases"/> for the other generic possibilities.

          <li><title> Speeding up </title>
            <p>When the acceleration is in the same direction as the original velocity, the object speeds up; this is shown by the final velocity vector being larger than the original velocity vector (by the amount <m>\Delta \vec{v} </m>).

          <li><title> Slowing down </title>
            <p>When the acceleration is in the opposite direction as the original velocity, the object slows down; this is shown by the final velocity vector being smaller than the original velocity vector (by the amount <m>\Delta\vec{v} </m>).    
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><title> Changing direction </title> 
          <p> When the acceleration is perpendicular to the direction of the original velocity, the object changes direction only; this is shown by the final velocity vector being the same size as the original velocity vector.    
          </p>
          </li>
          <li> <title>Other possibilities</title>
          <p> When the acceleration is at any other angle with respect to the direction of the original velocity, the object's final velocity will change in both magnitude and direction.

        <p>
             Note also that the same distinctions hold for average and instantaneous accelerations (as well as for many other dynamics quantities in Part 1 of this learning guide). For example, as the two points in <xref ref ="figure-car-on-curve"/> become closer to one another, the time interval shrinks, and the average acceleration approaches an instantaneous value.

  <exercise xml:id="kin-num-practice">
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Let's now explore a few additional kinematics examples to get more practice with these basic definitions and equations.   
    </p>
  </introduction>
    <task>
         <statement>
            <p>
              If you travel at 60 mph for one hour, how far do you travel?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p> 
              This first question is intended to be simple enough for you to get the answer from your everyday experience. However, we can connect this question with our kinematics discussion by recognizing that <q>60 mph</q> is a rate of covering distance, or a <em>speed</em>. We can therefore use the definition of speed, <m> s=\frac{d}{t}</m>. Since we're given both the speed and the time, we can easily rearrange the speed equation<mdash/> i.e, by multiplying both sides of the equation by <m>t</m><mdash/> to solve for <m>d</m>:  
            <me>d=s \cdot t = (60 \text{mph})(1 \text{hour})= \frac{60 \text{miles}}{1 \text{hour}}\cdot 1 \text{hour} = 60 miles</me>
            </p>
            <p> Note that the same approach would apply for any time period, such as 8 minutes, though some conversation of units would be necessary. We could choose to either convert 60mph into <q>miles per minute</q> or convert the 8 minutes into hours (or convert miles into meters and both hours and minutes into seconds if we wanted to report the answer in SI units). Let's do the simplest calculation possible:
            <me>d=s \cdot t = (60 \text{mph})(8 \text{minutes})= \frac{60 \text{miles}}{60 \text{minutes}}\cdot 8 \text{minutes} = 8 miles</me>
            </p>
        </answer>
    </task>
    <task>
         <statement>
            <p>
              A bird can fly 25 kilometers per hour (25 km/h). How long does it take to fly 15 km?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p> 
              We can connect this question with our kinematics discussion by recognizing that <q>25 km/h</q> is a speed. We can therefore use the definition of speed (<m> s=\frac{d}{t}</m>) again. However, in this case we are given the speed and the distance traveled, so we need to rearrange the speed equation to solve for the time. (We can do so by multiplying both sides by <m>t</m> and then dividing both sides by <m>s</m>.) 
            <me>t= \frac{d}{s} = \frac{15 \text{km}}{25 \text{km/h}}= \frac{15 \text{km}}{25 \text{km/h}} = .60 \text{h}</me>.
            Notice that we could convert the time into minutes (more practical) or seconds (if we wanted to report the answer in SI units):
            <me> .60 \text{h} = (.60 \text{h})\cdot \frac{60 \text{min}}{1 \text{h}}=36 \text{min} </me>
            or
            <me>.60 \text{h}= (.60 \text{h})\cdot \frac{3600 \text{sec}}{1 \text{h}}=2200\text{s} </me>
          </p>   
        </answer>
    </task>
    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A car advertisement states that a car can acceleration from rest to 60 mph in 6.0 seconds. What is the magnitude of its average acceleration over this time interval?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p> To solve this problem, we need to first recognize that both "rest" and "60 mph" represent instantaneous speeds and recall that the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity is the instantanteous speed. We can then use the definition of average acceleration to find the answer:
        <me> \vec{a}_{\text{ave}} = \frac{\Delta\vec{v}}{\Delta t} =\frac {60 \text{mph}}{6.0 \text{seconds}} = \frac {10 \text{mph}}{s} </me>
        We notice that this answer has mixed units, but we can still interpret that physically, this indicates that the car's speed increases by 10 mph for every second of travel. If desired, we could convert to standard US Customary units (since a mile is equal to 5280 ft and an hour is equal to 3600 seconds) or SI units (since a mile is equal to 1.609 kilometers). You're encouraged to do both; the answers are provided below so that you can check your work.
        <me> \frac{10 \text{mph}}{s} = \frac {10 mi}{hr \cdot s} = 15 ft/s^2 = 4.5 m/s^2</me>

  <p> To motivate this discussion, let's return to the example of the grocery store trip from <xref ref="grocery-store-trip"/>. A graph of the motion previously described is shown in <xref ref="figure-grocery-graph"/> below. 
  </p>
<figure width="85%" xml:id="figure-grocery-graph">

     </figure>

  <p>There are several things to notice from the graphs above:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        The <em>direction</em> of the motion is evident from the slope of the postion graph: the slope is positive when moving towards the store and negative when moving away.  
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The <em>speed</em> of the motion is also related to the slope of the position graph: a slope of larger magnitude indicates higher speed. (For example, compare the slope of the first part of the trip to the slope of the last part, and relate to the results cited in <xref ref="ex-speed-velocity "/>.)     
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        We can use the graphs above to visualize our previous observation that the time interval determines the value of average velocity. For example, compare the slope of the each part of the trip to the slope of the overall trip (the red line shown in the above graph at right), and relate to the results cited in <xref ref="ex-speed-velocity "/>.)     
      </p>

  <p>
        Let's consider what a graph of position vs time can tell us in general terms. Recall the equation of a straight line: 
         <me>y=m \cdot x + b </me>
         where <m>y</m> is the dependent variable (plotted along the vertical axis), <m>x</m> is the independent variable (plotted along the horizontal axis), <m>b</m> is the "y-intercept" (the value of <m>y</m> when <m>x=0</m>), and <m>m</m> is the <em>slope</em> of the line, given by the equation: 
         <me>m=\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{y_2 - y_1} {x_2-x_1} </me>.
         Comparing the definition of slope to the equation for average velocity,
         <me>\vec{v}_{\text{ave}} = \frac{\Delta\vec{x}}{\Delta t} = \frac{\vec{x}_{\text{final}} - \vec{x}_{\text{initial}}}{t_{\text{final}} - t_{\text{initial}}} </me>, 
      we can see that if we plot position vs time, the slope will be the average velocity: the position <m>\vec{x}</m> plays the role of the dependent variable <m>y</m>, the time <m>t</m> plays the role of the independent variable  <m>x</m>, and <m>\vec{v}_{\text{ave}}</m> plays the role of the slope, <m>m</m>.
      </p> 
      <p>
       If the velocity is constant, the graph of position vs time will have a constant slope (in other words, it will be a straight line), with the instantaneous velocity at each point equal to the value of the average velocity. If the velocity is changing, as will often be the case, we can make use of definition of instantaneous values to realize that the value of the instantaneous velocity at any given time can be found from the slope of curve at that point on the position vs time graph.    
      </p>
    <p>GENERAL STATEMENT: The slope at any point of a position vs time graph is the (instantaneous) velocity at that point. 
      </p>
    <p>
       Similarly, if we consider a graph of velocity vs time, we find that its slope is given by the equation for average acceleration, as given in <xref ref="last-grocery-store"/>:  
         <me>\text{slope} =\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} =\frac{\Delta\vec{v}}{\Delta t} = \frac{\vec{v}_{\text{final}} - \vec{v}_{\text{initial}}}{t_{\text{final}} - t_{\text{initial}}} = \vec{a}_{\text{ave}} </me>. 
       So we see that if we plot velocity vs time, the slope will be the average acceleration: the (instantaneous) velocity <m>\vec{v}</m> plays the role of the dependent variable <m>y</m>, the time <m>t</m> plays the role of the independent variable  <m>x</m>, and <m>\vec{a}_{\text{ave}}</m> plays the role of the slope, <m>m</m>.
      </p> 
    <p>
       If the acceleration is constant (as will be the case in <xref ref="constant-a-lin-eqns"/>), the graph of velocity vs time will be a straight line, with the instantaneous acceleration at each point equal to the value of the average acceleration. If the acceleration is changing, as is often the case in real life, we can make use of definition of instantaneous values to realize that the value of the instantaneous acceleration at any given time can be found from the slope of curve at that point on the velocity vs time graph.    
      </p>
      <p>GENERAL STATEMENT: The slope at any point of a velocity vs time graph is the (instantaneous) acceleration at that point.

          <p>
            The graphs show objects that travel at the same speed but in opposite directions. We can use the equation for average velocity to see this mathematically. Assuming "away from origin" is chosen as the positive direction: 
          <me>\vec{v}_{\text{ave,A}} = \frac{\Delta\vec{x}}{\Delta t} = \frac{60{\text{miles} - 0\text{miles}}}{{30\text{minutes} - 0\text{minutes}}}=\frac{30\text{mi}}{30\text{min}}=2.0 \frac{\text{mi}}{\text{min}} </me>

          <p>
            The object in Graph (B) is moving faster, as seen immediately by the larger slope of its position graph. Mathematical justification: Both objects begin with an initial position of 0 miles and travel for 30 minutes. Graph (A) shows a final position of 30 miles, while Graph (B) shows a final position of 60 miles. We could calculate each speed from the equation for speed, but since these graphs both show 1D motion in a single direction, we know that the magnitude of the average velocity is the same as the average speed. So we can simply use the equation for average velocity again but without the vector signs:  
           <me>v_{\text{ave,A}} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{30{\text{miles} - 0\text{miles}}}{{30\text{minutes} - 0\text{minutes}}}=\frac{30\text{mi}}{30\text{min}}=1.0 \frac{\text{mi}}{\text{min}}</me>

        </statement>
        <answer>
          <p>
            These two graphs indicate the <em>same average velocity</em> (and hence the same average speed over the time interval shown), because both objects have the same initial and final positions and travel for the same amount of time. Mathematical justification: Both objects change position by the same amount (60 miles) and travel for the same amount of time (30 minutes). We can again calculate each speed by considering only the magnitude of velocity:  
            <me>v_{\text{ave,A}} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{60{\text{miles} - 0\text{miles}}}{{30\text{minutes} - 0\text{minutes}}}=\frac{60\text{mi}}{30\text{min}}=2.0 \frac{\text{mi}}{\text{min}}</me> 
          <me> v_{\text{ave,B}} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{60{\text{miles} - 0\text{miles}}}{{30\text{minutes}} - 0\text{minutes}}= \frac{60\text{mi}}{30\text{min}} =2.0 \frac{\text{mi}}{\text{min}}</me>
          </p>
          <p> Here again, we see that the time interval under consideration affects the average velocity (and thus, average speed). Since the slope of Graph (B) is constant, the object travels at the same velocity the entire time. In contrast, the changing slope of Graph (A) shows that its velocity isn't constant the entire time: the object travels fastest for the first 10 minutes, is stationary for the next 10 minutes, and then continues in the same direction but at a slower speed for the last 10 minutes.

         <answer>
          <p>
           Graph (A) shows 2 places of acceleration, because the velocity of the object changed twice: it slowed down at the 10 minute mark and it sped up at 20 minute mark. Although all three instantaneous velocities can be determined from this graph (make sure you know how to do this), we notice that the acceleration can't be calculated from this idealized graph since it indicates that the changes happened instantly (time interval is zero).

        <p>
          The equations in this subsection are only true for the <em>special case of constant acceleration</em>. Constant acceleration is a small subset of all possible motions, so be sure to ask yourself whether the motion of interest is undergoing constant acceleration <em>before</em> you try to use the equations in <xref ref="subsubsec-constant-accel-eqns"/> or <xref ref="table-eqns-const-lin-a"/>. That said, constant acceleration is somewhat common in nature; for example, objects falling under the influence of only gravity (without air resistance) undergo constant acceleration, and we'll encounter additional examples beginning in <xref ref="dynamics"/>. Furthermore, there are numerous examples of motion that can be <em>approximated</em> as constant acceleration, such as speeding up or slowing down at a relatively constant rate while walking or driving a car.

If we were to measure the position and velocity of an object in free fall, its motion would appear as shown in <xref ref="figure-free-fall"/> below. 
       </p>

     <figure width="80%" xml:id="figure-free-fall">
      <title>Object in Free Fall</title>
        <caption> Snapshots at five position-time pairs are shown, with position labeled to the left of each snapshot and time labeled to the right. The topmost snapshot shows the object at zero position and time, and subsequent snapshots show the object's position and time later in its journey, as measured relative to its beginning point. (Note that position is reported as <em>positive</em> in the <em>downward </em> direction in this case.) The far right column shows velocity magnitudes (reported to one significant figure), which could be measured by attaching a speedometer to the object. </caption>

    <p>
     Although in everyday life, only an extremely compact and heavy object could fall a distance of <m>80 m</m> with negligible air resistance (see also <xref ref="dynamics"/>), this somewhat idealized figure illustrates two fundamental observations that are true for any object in free fall:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The object falls successively larger distances per unit time as it falls. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The speed of the object increases at a uniform rate as it falls.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul> 
    Picking up on the second point, if we determine <m>\Delta \vec{v}</m> for each time interval shown, we see clearly that the velocity increases by <m>10 m/s</m> for each second the object falls. In other words, we can calculate the magnitude of the <em>acceleration</em> for any of the time intervals shown as    
    <me> a_{\text{ave}} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} =\frac {10 \text{m/s}}{1 \text{s}} = 10 m/s^2</me>.
    The direction of the acceleration due to gravity is always downward, towards the center of the earth, and it's generally denoted by <m>\vec{a}_{\text{g}}</m> or simply <m>\vec{g}</m>. The magnitude of <m>\vec{g}</m> varies slightly at different locations on earth, but to two significant figures, it's <m>9.8 m/s^2 </m>. You can look up its precise value at your location to keep the significant figures of <m>\vec{g}</m> from limiting the precision of your results in subsequent calculations; in most of the United States, it's between <m>9.79 m/s^2</m> and <m>9.81 m/s^2</m>.
    </p>
    <p></p> 
    <p>
    GENERAL STATEMENT: The acceleration due to gravity is given by:
    <me> \vec{a}_{\text{g}} =\vec{g} = 9.8 m/s^2 </me>.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p> We can also predict what the kinematics graphs of a freely-falling object would look like, based on the GENERAL STATEMENTS in <xref ref="graphing-motion"/>. Since the velocity is constantly increasing, the slope of the position graph would be constantly increasing (the mathematical way of saying this is that the position graph would be <q>parabolic</q>). <xref ref="figure-free-fall-graphs"/> shows sample data for the first half-second of a more realistic case; note that these graphs which align perfectly with our predictions.

            If you throw a ball upwards and it falls back to your hand, what would the velocity and acceleration values be at its highest point? 
          </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
          <p>
            The acceleration is constant during its entire flight; it's always <m>9.8 m/s^2 </m>, directed downward.
          </p>
          <p> As the ball rises upward, the acceleration is in the opposite direction as its velocity, so the ball slows down. As the ball falls back down towards your hand, the acceleration is in the same direction as its velocity, so the ball speeds up (see <xref ref="figure-acceleration-cases"/>). At the highest point (or "top of flight"), the ball transitions from a very small upward velocity to a very small downward velocity; its instantaneous velocity at that highest point is zero (0.0 m/s). 
          </p>   
         <p> NOTE: It's interesting to realize that the constant acceleration of free fall indicates that the ball's upward journey is symmetric to its downward journey: when the ball is at the same position along its path, it will have the same speed, so its velocity will have the same magnitude but opposite direction, as seen in the image below. This point will be explored quantitatively in <xref ref="subsubsec-constant-accel-eqns"/>.

        <title>Special case kinematics equations for constant acceleration</title>
      <idx><h>constant acceleration</h></idx> 
       <p>
       As previously emphasized, the equations presented here are only valid for the very special case of constant (translational) acceleration. They are NOT always true, and you won't get the correct answers if you use them for cases where the acceleration changes during the process of interest (for example, the grocery store trip in <xref ref="grocery-store-trip"/>). That said, these equations are extremely useful "shortcut" equations to use whenever the acceleration <em>is</em> constant. Other than a new way of thinking about the average velocity for the special case of constant acceleration, there's no new physics here! All of the physics is contained in the basic definitions in <xref ref="lin-kin-defns"/> (summarized in <xref ref="table-defns-lin-kin"/>); these special case equations are just simplifications and combinations of those definitions.  
       </p>
      <p>
      Since we just saw in <xref ref="subsubsec-free-fall"/> that objects in free fall undergo constant acceleration, we can refer to <xref ref="figure-free-fall"/> to motivate the new way of thinking of average velocity mentioned in the preceding paragraph. The first few seconds of this case are shown in <xref ref="ave.vel.is.inst.at.mid"/> below.
      </p>
      <figure width="80%" xml:id="ave.vel.is.inst.at.mid">

      <image source="graph.ave.instant.midpt.PNG" width="60%"> 
      <description> Graph is linear, with two points identified via dashed lines as follows: velocity is 10m/s at time of 1 s and velocity is 20m/s at time of 2 s.</description>

    <p>   
      Consider the object's ("final") velocity after it has fallen for 2 seconds, and ask yourself two questions:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            What is its average velocity after falling two seconds?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            At what time does its instantaneous velocity equal this value?
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>   
    The answers to these two questions follow:  
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p> We can use the definition of <em>average velocity</em> from <xref ref="more-grocery-store"/> and the corresponding displacement of 20 m in the downward direction (as shown in <xref ref="figure-free-fall"/>) to determine that the average velocity is <em>downward</em> with a magnitude of: 
          <me> v_{\text{ave}} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{20 \text{m}}{2\text{s}} = 10 m/s </me>. 

          NOTE: If you thought the answer was 20 m/s, you're likely conflating average and instantaneous values. The numbers given in <xref ref="figure-free-fall"/>  - and hence plotted in <xref ref="ave.vel.is.inst.at.mid"/> - are <em>instantaneous</em> values at the times indicated (or in other words,  the "final" values at the end of the corresponding time intervals).   
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We see from both <xref ref="figure-free-fall"/> and <xref ref="ave.vel.is.inst.at.mid"/> that the velocity is 10 m/s at a time of 1 s. We also notice that one second is midway between the "initial" time of zero seconds and the "final" time of two seconds, which motivates the general statement below.       
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
</p> 
<p></p>
  <p>
    GENERAL STATEMENT: For an object undergoing constant acceleration, the average velocity over any time interval is equal to the instantaneous velocity at the midpoint in time, and an alternative way to calculate its value is:
    <men> \vec{v}_{\text{ave}}=\frac{ \vec{v}_{\text{initial}} + \vec{v}_{\text{final}} }{2} </men>
    As an aside: we may note that we can always calculate the average value of anything by adding up as many values as we have and dividing by the number of values; what's special about a linear function  - like the velocity of an object undergoing uniform acceleration - is that we only need to use two values (the beginning and ending values).   
  </p>
  <p>
 The other three "special case equations" are found from rearranging the kinematics definitions from <xref ref="lin-kin-defns"/>, simplifying for the case of constant acceleration (<m>\vec{a}_{\text{ave}} \rightarrow \vec{a}) </m>, starting our clock at zero (<m>t_{\text{initial}} = 0 </m> and <m>t_{\text{final}} \rightarrow t </m>), and sometimes making use of the "special case equation" for average velocity above. 
 </p>
 <p>
 We can rearrange the definition of average acceleration and simplify to obtain: 
  <men> \vec{v}_{\text{final}}= \vec{v}_{\text{initial}} + \vec{a}\cdot t </men>
This equation is particularly useful to find the velocity at any desired time if we know the acceleration and initial velocity (or to find any unknown quantity in the equation if given the others). 
 </p>
 <p></p>
 <p>
Combining the two equations for average velocity (the definition from  <xref ref="more-grocery-store"/> and the special case equation above) and rearranging gives:    
  <men> \vec{x}_{\text{final}}= \vec{x}_{\text{initial}} + \vec{v}_{\text{initial}}\cdot t + \frac{1}{2} \vec{a}\cdot t^2 </men>
This equation is particularly useful to find the position (or displacement) at any desired time if we know the acceleration and initial velocity (or to find any unknown quantity in the equation if given the others). 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Finally, we can eliminate <m>t</m> between the two preceding equations to obtain: 
  <men>\vec{v}_{\text{final}}^2= \vec{v}_{\text{initial}}^2 + 2 \vec{a}\cdot \Delta\vec{x} </men>
  This equation is particularly useful to relate the displacement of an object to its change in velocity; for example, to find the distance it takes a car to stop if its acceleration and initial velocity values are known, or to determine the initial speed a car was traveling from the length of the skid marks it leaves on the ground. For this reason, it is sometimes called the "braking distance equation." However, keep in mind it applies to any object undergoing constant acceleration - including free fall -  and like any equation, it can be rearranged to solve for any unknown variable.

  <task>
    <statement>
      <p>
      If you throw a ball straight up with an initial speed of 15 m/s, (a) with what speed will it later land in your hand, (b) how high will it rise, and (c) how much time will it take to land in your hand? (Assume air resistance can be neglected.)  
      </p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
      <p>
        It's a good practice to begin with a sketch; the image from the previous checkpoint applies here, where the initial velocity vector would be labeled 15 m/s. 
        <image source="symmetry.ff.PNG" width="20%">
         <description>Image shows velocity vectors of ball that's thrown straight upward and comes back down. The velocity vector is respresented by progressively smaller arrows as the ball rises and progressively larger arrows as it falls, with the upward arrows at each position matching the size of the downward arrows.</description>
        </image> 
        </p>
      <p>
        (a) We can immediately see from this sketch that the ball would land with the same speed it was thrown, or 15 m/s. Let's use the "constant acceleration equations" to confirm this. Since the ball lands at its original position, its displacement is zero. So we could use the displacement equation to find the time, and then substitute into the velocity equation. But here, since we don't care about the time (yet), we could do this in a single step using the "braking distance" equation:
         <me>\vec{v}_{\text{final}}^2= \vec{v}_{\text{initial}}^2 + 2 \vec{a}\cdot \Delta\vec{x} </me>.
        Since <m> \Delta \vec{x} = 0 </m>, the last term is zero, so we're left with
        <me>\vec{v}_{\text{final}}^2= \vec{v}_{\text{initial}}^2  </me>.
        This offers two possible solutions, <m>\vec{v}_{\text{final}} = \pm \vec{v}_{\text{initial}}.</m> Since this question only asked for speed, we know that the speed is 15 m/s. However, if we wanted to know the velocity, we could use our physical knowledge that the ball is moving downward (opposite to its initial direction) to select the negative sign. If we choose "up" as the positive direction, then the velocity is -15 m/s (or 15 m/s, downward).
        </p>
        <p> (b) Here, too, we have a variety of options for determining how high the ball will rise. We could return to the "braking distance" equation, recognizing that displacement is <em>height</em> in this case, for a one-step calculation, or we could use the velocity equation to find the time, keeping in mind that the velocity at the top is zero, and then use that time in the displacement equation. Since we just practiced with the braking distance equation, let's take the latter (two-step) approach here:   
        <me> \vec{v}_{\text{final}}= \vec{v}_{\text{initial}} + \vec{a}\cdot t </me>
        Substituting in <m> \vec{v}_{\text{final}}= 0m/s </m> and solving for time gives
         <me> t = -\frac {\vec{v}_{\text{initial}}} {\vec{a}} = - \frac {\vec{v}_{\text{initial}}} {\vec{g}} </me>
         <me>t = - \frac {15 m/s} {-9.8m/s^2} = 1.5 s </me>.   
          We can then substitute this value for time into the displacement equation: 
          <me> \vec{x}_{\text{final}}=\vec{x}_{\text{initial}} + \vec{v}_{\text{initial}}\cdot t + \frac{1}{2} \vec{a}\cdot t^2 </me>.
          Keeping in mind that zero position is arbitary (see <xref ref="grocery-store-trip"/>), we could logically choose <m>\vec{x}_{\text{initial}} =0 </m> (or even <m>\vec{x}_{\text{final}}=0 </m>). However, since the ball's <em> displacement</em> above your hand is the only thing we care about, we could just as well rewrite the displacement equation as 
           <me> \Delta \vec{x} = \vec{v}_{\text{initial}}\cdot t + \frac{1}{2} \vec{a}\cdot t^2 </me>   
          <me>\Delta \vec{x} = (15 m/s)(1.5 s) + \frac{1}{2} (-9.8 m/s^2)(1.5 s)^2 = 11 m  </me>    
        </p>
      <p>(c) Once again, we have a variety of options. The quickest is to use the symmetry of the situation to realize that the ball will take the same amount of time to fall as it did to fall, so we could simply double the rise time that we just found in part b; since it took 1.5 s to rise, it will take another 1.5 s to fall, so it will take 3.0 s to land back in your hand:
      <me>t_{\text{total}} =t_{\text{up}}+t_{\text{down}}=2\cdot t_{\text{up}}= 2(1.5 s)= 3.0s </me>. 
     Another approach (if we didn't notice the symmetry), would be to use the displacement equation to calculate the time, since we know all the other variables in that equation. In general, solving the displacement equation for time involves solving a quadratic equation, but in cases of zero displacement the calculation is even simpler.  (Reminder, we know the displacement is sero for Part (c) since the ball lands at the same position from which it was thrown.) Let's see how this works out and make sure we get the same answer for time: 
     <me> \Delta \vec{x} = \vec{v}_{\text{initial}}\cdot t + \frac{1}{2} \vec{a}\cdot t^2 </me> 
     Substituting in the known quantities gives
    <me> 0 m =(15 m/s) \cdot t + \frac{1}{2}(-9.8m/s^2)\cdot t^2 </me>  
      Dividing the equation by <m>t</m> and then solving for <m>t</m>, we have 
      <me> t = \frac{(2)(15 m/s)}{9.8 m/s^2}=3.0 s </me>,
      which matches the approach based on symmetry.

This example will help to clearly define terms and ellucidate the connection to translational motion. Relying on what we learned previously in <xref ref="lin-kin"/> will allow us to build our toolkit quickly by making use of the analagous definitions and equations for translational motion.

          <title>Acceleration of an object on a rotating turntable</title>
        <caption> Similar to <xref ref="figure-ang-velocity"/>, with only one penny shown for simplicity; this snapshot  has (translational) acceleration vector overlaid. We note that the acceleration is neither parallel   </caption>
      <image source="ang.acceleration.PNG" width="60%"> 
      <description> Three images: (A), (B), and (C). Each image shows two colored circles (representing pennies) placed along the diameter of a larger circle (representing the turntable). Image (A) includes an arrow to show counter-clockwise rotation. Image (B) includes a dotted horizontal line through the two pennies (to mark the beginning position of the turntable) and another dotted vertical line (to mark its final position), as well as dotted curves showing the motion path of each penny. Image (C) also includes two additional features for each penny: a radius vector (pointing from the center of the turntable to the penny's location) and the angle each penny moves through. </description>
