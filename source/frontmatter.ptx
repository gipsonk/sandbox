    <p> This learning guide makes frequent use of external open-source content. Two collections that
      are featured largely in the following pages merit specific acknowledgement: 
      <ul>
        <li>
          <title>
            PhET simulations
          </title>
          <p> These interactive simulations are created and maintained by a team of researchers at
      the University of Colorado Boulder. They focus on active learning through exploration and
      discovery in an intuitive, game-like environment.
          </p>

          <title>
            <q>Hewitt-Drew-It</q> youtube videos </title>
          <p> Paul Hewitt has influenced thousands of students and educators (including the author
      of this learning guide) through his engagingly simple way of explaining and connecting physics
      concepts. Links to specific episodes in his youtube video series, <q>Hewitt-Drew-It</q>, are
      included to augment and illustrate the physics concepts presented. </p>

    <p> </p>
    <p> The author also expresses gratitude to the students, faculty, staff, and administration of
      Grand Valley State University, without whom this learning guide would not exist. Feedback from
      students over many years evidenced its need, faculty colleagues shared useful expertise, staff
      provided assistance with technical aspects, and the administration provided a sabbatical leave
      to begin this project.

  <preface>
    <p> This learning guide is intended to support students in a one-semester survey of physics
      topics that are most directly related to health sciences; it covers fundamental topics in
      classical physics and selected topics in quantum physics. The physics content is presented
      very succinctly, with the unifying theme of human body and health science applications
      providing context and motivation. Interactive features are included to foster student
      engagement and promote integration of the material.
    </p>
    <p> Mathematics is sometimes said to be the <q>language</q> of physics, because it allows
      complicated relationships to be expressed in simple terms. This learning guide uses only basic
      algebra, and learners without recent algebra experience may wish to review core concepts using
      the links provided in <xref ref="algebra" />. </p>
    <p> Each chapter opens with a few guiding questions for learners to keep in mind while engaging
      with the material, and closes with an overview of selected health science applications. The
      body of each chapter includes succinct discussion of physics terms and concepts, illustrated
      and expanded via brief videos and interactive simulations and exercises.
