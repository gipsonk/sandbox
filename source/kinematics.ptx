          <title>Kinematics definitions applied to grocery store trip</title> 
             <introduction>
            <p> Let's use the example of the grocery store trip to explore these initial kinematics definitions.

          <exercise>
          <statement>
              <p>
                What two choices of <em>zero</em> position are most logical?
              </p>
            </statement>
            <answer>
              <p>
                Choosing <em>zero</em> position at either your home or the store would simplify the math.

          <exercise>
          <statement>
            <p>
              What <em>distance</em> did you travel?
            </p>
          </statement>
          <answer>
            <p>
              You traveled a distance of 10 blocks: 2 blocks towards the store, then 2 blocks to go back home to retrive your wallet, then the final 6 blocks to the store. In equation form, we can use <em>d</em> to represent <em>distance</em> and write 
            </p>
            <p> <m>d = 2 bks + 2 bks + 6 bks = 10 bks</m> </p>
          </answer>

        <exercise>
          <statement>
            <p>
              What was your <em>displacement</em>?
            </p>
          </statement>
          <answer>
            <p>
              Your displacement was 6 blocks to the east. (Don't forget that <em>direction</em> is part of the answer for any vector!) Let's calculate the displacement for each of the two most logical choices of <em>zero</em> position to confirm that we get the same result: 
            </p> 
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li> <title><p>Choose <em>zero</em> position at your home:</p></title>
                  <p> In this case, the initial position is 0 blocks and the final position is 6 blocks to the east, so displacement (delta x) is given by:
                  </p> 
                </li>
                <li><title><p> Choose <em>zero</em> position at the store:</p></title>
                  <p> In this case, the initial position is 6 blocks to the west (or <em>negative east</em>) and the final position is 0 blocks, so displacement (delta x) is given by:
                  </p> 
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          </answer>
