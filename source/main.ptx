    <preface> 
      <p> This learning guide is intended to support students in a one-semester survey of physics topics that are most directly related to health sciences; it covers fundamental topics in classical physics and selected topics in quantum physics. The physics content is presented very succinctly, with the unifying theme of human body and health science applications providing context and motivation. Interactive features are included to foster student engagement and promote integration of the material. 
        </p> 
      <p> Mathematics is sometimes said to be the <q>language</q> of physics, because it allows complicated relationships to be expressed in simple terms. This learning guide uses only basic algebra, and learners without recent algebra experience may wish to review core concepts using the links provided in <xref ref="algebra"/>.
       </p>
      <p> Each chapter opens with a few guiding questions for learners to keep in mind while engaging with the material, and closes with an overview of selected health science applications. The body of each chapter includes succinct discussion of physics terms and concepts, illustrated and expanded via brief videos and interactive simulations and exercises.

            Here are some questions to keep in mind as you read and work through the content in Chapter 1:

          <li> What is physics? </li>

      <section xml:id="prelim-concepts">
        <title>Preliminary Concepts</title>
        <p> We begin our study of physics by considering what physics actually is and its relation to health sciences.
        </p> 
        <subsection xml:id="matter-and-energy">
        <title> Matter and Energy</title>
        <p>At its core, physics is the study of the physical world. For this reason, physics is often defined as the <em>study of matter and energy</em>. Matter and energy will appear (both implicitly and explicitly) throughout this learning guide, along with many other related terms and theoretical constructs that have been developed over the centuries to explain the physical aspect of reality and make accurate predictions.  
        </p>
        
         <p> 
          As stated above, energy is a core physics concept. We will see beginning in the next chapter that one of the most fundamental theoretical constructs in physics is the <em>Law of Conservation of Energy</em>. The PhET simulation below introduces you to some of the diverse forms of energy that will be explored in more detail in subsequent chapters. In particular, we will spend more time on the <q>Intro</q> tab of this PhET in <xref ref="thermo"/>; at this point you may prefer to instead focus on the <q>Systems</q> tab to become familar with how the PhETs work and to see how one form of energy can be converted into another. As you explore this PhET, consider the following suggestions: 
           <ul> 
            <li> Turn on the <q>Energy symbols</q> option (in the upper right corner) to observe how the various forms of energy convert into one another. </li> 
            <li> Try different combinations of the various energy sources (on the lower left side) and generators (middle of lower side). </li>    
            <li> When you find a particularly energetic combination of source and generator, experiment with connecting the various devices (on the lower right side) to the generator. </li> 
          </ul>

        <title>Relevance of Physics to Health Sciences </title>
          <p> Physics undergirds health sciences in two main ways:
            <ol>
              <li> <title>Understanding the human body</title>            
                <p>Health sciences aim to improve human health by understanding the human body, which on a physical level is composed of matter and energy. The material in Part 1 is relevant to understanding the motion of the human body, while the material in Parts 2 through 4 is relevant to understanding the internal workings of the human body as well as its interactions with the external world. 
                  </p>
              </li>
              <li> <title>Understanding common health sciences technologies</title>
                <p> Virtually all technology is based on physics. Many examples of technologies related to health sciences are discussed throughout this learning guide, and Part 4 is necessary to understand more modern technologies.   
                  </p>

      <section xml:id="nature-of-science">
        <title>The Nature of Science</title>
        <p>Physics is sometimes said to be the most <em>fundamental science</em>, because all natural sciences <ndash/> such as biology, chemistry, geology, and the various interdisciplinary and applied sciences <ndash/> are essentially attempts to understand the <em>physical</em> aspects of the natural world through careful observation and experimentation. Specifically, <em>fundamental</em> in this sense doesn't mean <q>most important</q> but rather <q>most basic,</q> as all other natural sciences rely upon physics, at least at the microscopic scale. Therefore, although the following discussion about the nature of science uses physics examples, this discussion applies equally well to all natural sciences. (The reader is invited to consider whether it is also applicable to the various social and political sciences.)       
          </p>
        
          <subsection xml:id="sci-method"> 
          <title>The Scientific Method</title>  
          <p> Since a hallmark of science is its reproducibility, the scientific method is an approach to investigating the natural world that seeks to remove biases of the investigator. It is generally presented as a series of sequential steps, but it's important to keep in mind that science is actually an iterative process; in practice the result of any given step often motivates the return to an earlier step before progressing to the next step. The short video below begins by showing how the scientific method applies to solving problems in every day life.     
          </p>
            <figure>
              <title>One Version of the Scientific Method</title>
              <caption>A video discussion of the scientific method (about 4 minutes)</caption>
              <video xml:id="sci-meth-vid" youtube="SMGRe824kak"/>
            </figure>   
                    
          <p> There are various ways to frame the scientific method, and different presentations typically include 4 <ndash/> 8 separate steps. The essential steps common to most presentations are: 
            <ol>
            <li> <title>Observation</title>
              <p> Making observations of natural phenomena is the beginning of any scientific inquiry.   
                </p> 
            </li>
            <li> <title>Hypothesis</title>
              <p> A hypothesis is essentially an educated guess, based on existing knowledge. Generally research is useful in formulating a scientific hypothesis, and the hypothesis results in one or more specific predictions, so <em>research</em> and <em>predictions</em> are sometimes presented as separate steps (as in the video above).                
                </p> 
            </li> 
            <li> <title>Experimentation</title>
              <p>The predictions are tested in the context of carefully controlled experiments, ideally varying only one parameter at a time to isolate its effect.  
                </p> 
            </li> 
            <li> <title>Theoretical Construct</title>
              <p> Depending on the results of the previous steps, new theoretical constructs <ndash/> such as models, equations, theories, and laws <ndash/>  may emerge. If so, they are typically shared with the scientific community (via the process of professional presentations or peer reviewed publications) so that others can also engage in testing and refining them. (The video presents <em>sharing results</em> as the final step of the scientific method.)  
                </p> 
            </li> 
            </ol>
          </p>

          <p> As an example, consider the behavior of a pendulum, which will be explored in more detail in <xref ref="sound"/>. A scientist may <em>observe</em> an object on a string oscillating to<ndash/>and<ndash/>fro and <em>hypothesize</em> about which of its physical characteristics (or <q>parameters</q>) affect the rate at which it oscillates. Predictions made be made about how parameters such as mass or shape of the object, the mass or length of the string, how far the object is pulled to the side before being released, etc. affect the rate of oscillation. Careful <em>experiments</em> could then be performed to test each of these predictions by varying only the parameter under consideration without changing any other parameters. The results of this process might be a <em>theoretical construct</em> in the form of an equation. 
          </p>

          <p> Two notes are appropriate in closing this discussion. First, many scientific discoveries have been made by other methods, and the history of science is flush with accidental discoveries as well as discoveries that were made by skipping steps in this process; still, most scientists agree that the process above provides a systematic method of approaching scientific inquiry. Secondly, there has been some skepticism surrounding the scientific method in recent years; the subsequent subsection places such skepticism in context, and there are many excellent resources for readers who may be impacted by such controversy.
